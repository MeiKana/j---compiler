3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types): 
   make two new class file literalong.java and literalDouble.java
   add new "else if" in the last literal() method.
   then, modify seeBasicType(), BasicType() and Type.java let then able to
   recognize this two new type.

   Problem 2 (Operators): 
   Add those class of opreators in assignment.java, BinaryExpression.java and so
   on... 
   Then, add new "else if" in assignmentExpression() to return those new classes.
   
   Problem 3 (Conditional Expression): 
   added some new method like condtionalExpression()... in parser.java and make 
   a new AST node JConditionalExpression to support this new function.

   Problem 4 (Switch Statement):
   Make a new AST node called JSwitchStatement.
   Use hashtable two save the case and block.
   Modify the statement() method.

   Problem 5 (Do-While Statement): ...
    Make a new AST node called JDoWhileStatement.
    Modify the statement() method.
    Which is much like the while statement.
   Problem 6 (For Statement):
    In JForStatment, use JStatement, JExpression and JStatement to represnt the
    init value, condition and updates. And use a JStatement for the body.
    Them added tons of code in statement().
    
   Problem 7 (Exception Handlers): 
   Make a new AST node called JTryCatchFinallyStatement.
   I use an ArrayList<JStatement> to save the cases.

   Problem 8 (Interface Type Declaration): 
   Imitate the classDeclaration, 80% of those code are same.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------
   No
   ...                ...          ...

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Not difficult, but a lot of trivial works.
